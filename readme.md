# Wizard Stones

Wizard Stones is a JavaScript web game, built on React-Flux, inspired by the webgame [2048](http://2048game.com/) created by [Gabriele Circulli](http://gabrielecirulli.com/), which was in turn inspired by [1024](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/1024!/id823499224) by Veewo Studio and [Threes](http://asherv.com/threes/) by Asher Vollmer.  The game is one in which players attempt to combine similar mana stones across a four-by-four matrix.  The game is offers a few conceptually distinct features that are not in 2048.  Most importantly moves that do not result in a pieces changing place will still result in tile placement, this can either ease a board situation or make it all the more intractable.  Another change is the potential for a move to result in the placement of two stones instead of one roughly 5% of the time, and these new tiles are not restricted to borders.
